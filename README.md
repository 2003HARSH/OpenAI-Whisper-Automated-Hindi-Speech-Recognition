# OpenAI Whisper Automated Speech Recognition (Hindi)

Welcome to the OpenAI Whisper Automated Speech Recognition (Hindi) project! This repository contains code and resources for building an automated speech recognition (ASR) system tailored for the Hindi language. The goal is to provide an efficient and accurate transcription tool for a variety of applications, from automatic transcriptions to voice commands and accessibility tools.

## Features

- **Custom ASR for Hindi**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe Hindi audio into text.
- **Word Error Rate (WER) Evaluation**: Provides a method to assess the accuracy of transcriptions.
- **Customizable**: Allows for fine-tuning and adaptation to various contexts within Hindi-language speech recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
